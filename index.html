      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Joshua Jainga (Hi-ing-ga), thought I would give people a helping hand on how to say my last name. I am a pretty down to earth guy who is always up for trying new things. I am currently working as an operations manager but I am trying to find what real sparks my passion. I am always up for helping others and providing a listening ear. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Washington State and grew up in Kent,WA. went to local schools and got my degree in Economics from Eastern Washington University.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My hobbies include hiking, playing video games and I am becoming a avid photographer. 
        I was a runner all through high school and that really shaped me for my love of being active which has evolved into my love for hiking.
        I have always been captivated by video games ever since the N64. From racing on Timber's Island to resucing Cortona from the Covenant to now relaxing on my own personal island with some animal friends, video games have always been an escape from reality and to live a story that you otherwise couldnt live. 
        I have taken 6 years of photo classes through school but since gratudating I never really used these skills. Recently I decided to set a goal to take more photos and dive back into this passion of mine by making time for myself. It has been fun to relearn old skills and develop new ones and I hope I can keep this hobbie going!    </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to be able to build and create. I want to be able to make real change within a company or how people live their everyday lives. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Sammamish Washington</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The past few years have been full with new experiences, promotions, growth, rewards, struggles all having their highs and their lows. Although I have learned alot I still felt I haven't been moving towards my own personal  dreams. Signing up and being apart of this program is the first real step I took in accomplishing one of my own goals. With these skills I believe I can actually pursue my goals and make a change.</p>
